Selling Rights

-	Not every file in your profile will be sold.

-	You can re share a file in other sessions as per the previously discussed rules, until you meet the minimum requirements for you to be able to sell it.
-	When selling your file, you get 85% from the selling price you would have charged. 

However, a badge code may be entered buy a buyer at checkout point to increase your cut to 95% of the selling price.


B) Fans

-	NB: If you always voted for all files loaded in a group (previous 7 groups), and you finish all your voting rights before reaching the above specified number of groups that you have bought for, then you can contact admin and request for an additional OTP with additional voting rights. This can be repeated until  you reach all the number of groups meant to be covered by the amount that you initially paid.
